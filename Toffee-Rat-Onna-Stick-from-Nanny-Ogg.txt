Ingredients:

500 g white marzipan
1 strawberry licorice bootlace (twizzler)
6 ounces toffee icing
16 ounces chocolate sprinkles
1/4 cup black icing
6 tablespoons white sugar
4 tablespoons water

Directions:

1
You will also need: brown thread (for non-edible whiskers- optional) and 4 toffee apple sticks.
2
Break the Marzipan into 4 equal pieces and shape into rats.
3
Trim the bootlace to size and insert appropriately for tails.
4
Coat the bodies with a thin layer of toffee spread and roll them in the chocolate sprinkles to give the effect of fur.
5
Use a small blob of icing for the eyes.
6
If doing whiskers cut a few 5 cm lengths of thread and 'sew' them through the nose.
7
Gently push a stick up each-- er, rat, making sure it is secure.
8
It's all a bit dreadful, isn't it?.
9
Bust still much better than using a real rat.
10
In a heavy bottoms pan dissolve the sugar in the water and cook over a medium heat until it's golden brown (warning this gets very hot so be careful!).
11
When it's ready turn off the heat and quickly coat each rat in it- do NOT use a pastry brush as it will melt!
12
Place the rats in a cool dry place to set.
